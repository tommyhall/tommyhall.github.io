    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>A client in the wine education space&mdash;offering in-person courses and tours&mdash;wanted to expand into online courses and certification, improve their mobile experience, and refresh their website. The business was run by a Master of Wine and had a solid reputation, but they lacked insight into who their audience really was and how to reach them online.</p>
    <p>They brought us in to help them understand their users, refine their online course offering, and improve the overall user experience, especially on mobile.</p>
    <p>The project ran for about six weeks, and we had to balance research, design, and testing in a short timeline.</p>

    <h2>Team &amp; Role</h2>
    <p>I worked on this project as a user research consultant, alongside my business partner, who was also a researcher. We split the work evenly, and checked in regularly to keep things aligned.</p>
    <p>I focused more on stakeholder and user interviews, as well as the usability testing and iteration of the prototypes. My partner led a competitor analysis and expert review of the website. We both contributed to synthesizing insights, interaction design, and shaping the final recommendations.</p>

    <h2>Insights &amp; Recommendations</h2>
    <p><strong>Wine certification was a mystery</strong>. Even among wine enthusiasts, there was limited awareness or understanding of wine certification&mdash;how it worked, what the levels meant, or why it mattered. In person, the Master of Wine could explain this directly to interested people on his tours, but online, the offering needed to stand on its own. We added clear, engaging explanations about the certification process, to demystify it and make it feel worthwhile.</p>
    <p><strong>Customers wanted more detail (not less)</strong>. Because the client was seen as a trusted expert, users were actually willing to read more about the courses and certifications. Prototypes that highlighted the clientâ€™s expertise were better received. Rather than minimizing text, we focused on making it easy to scan, while still offering deeper details for those who wanted them.</p>
    <p>As in any online education platform, users cared about more than just the course content&mdash;they also considered location, instructor background, reviews from past course-takers, and cost. We ensured that the new design surfaced this information clearly, and supported multiple ways to explore and filter courses, helping people find what mattered most to them.</p>

    <h2>Outcome &amp; Impact</h2>
    <p>By the end of the project, the clinet had:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new, user-tested website design, with improved mobile support and a clearer, more compelling online course experience ready to expand their business.</li>
      <li>A stronger understanding of their audience, along with a roadmap for future research.</li>
      <li>Improved conversion rates for their course offerings, following the launch of the new site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The client was very happy with the outcome, and the site we designed is still in use today. It has continued to perform well, providing the client with a durable, effective solution for their expanded online business.</p>
