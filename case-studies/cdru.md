    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>The Child Development Research Unit (CDRU) is a research laboratory at the University of Guelph that studies developmental issues related to child health. I was hired to help the CDRU researchers design and build a virtual reality (VR) training game to help teach children to cross the street more safely, in a number of realistic suburban environments.</p>
