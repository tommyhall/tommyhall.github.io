    <p><strong>I'm Tom&mdash;a user researcher, strategist, and creative problem-solver.</strong></p>
    <p>I’ve been a researcher since 2010, helping teams make better decisions through clear, actionable insights. I believe great products start with understanding people, and that research should be practical, approachable, and focused on what actually matters.</p>
    <p>I’ve led research in-house and as a consultant across media, health &amp; wellness, education, VR, and games—on titles like <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and <em>Mario+Rabbids</em>. No matter the project, the goal is always the same: help teams create things that people actually want while reducing risk through smarter, more informed decisions.</p>
    <p>With a background in computer science and software development, I bring a human-centred approach to both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
    <p>This page is a no-frills look at some of my expertise. If you have questions, let’s chat.</p>
