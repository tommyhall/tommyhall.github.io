    <p><strong>I'm Tom&mdash;a user researcher, strategist, and creative problem-solver.</strong></p>
    <p>I’ve been a researcher since 2010, helping teams make better decisions through clear, actionable insights. I believe great products start with understanding people, and that research should be practical, approachable, and focused on what actually matters.</p>
    <p>I’ve led research in-house and as a consultant across media, health &amp; wellness, education, VR, and games&mdash;on titles like <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and <em>Mario+Rabbids</em>. No matter the project, the goal is always the same: help teams create things that people actually want while reducing risk through smarter, more informed decisions.</p>
    <p>With a background in computer science and software development, I bring a human-centred approach to both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
    <p>This page is a no-frills look at some of my expertise. If you have questions, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact">let’s chat</a>.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>I've delivered hundreds of research projects over the years. Below, I've selected some that I think are particularly interesting or highlight different skills and approaches.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Case Study 1: <a href="#">Bringing wine education online</a></li>
      <li>Case Study 2: <a href="#">Standing up research and delivering insights in less than a month</a></li>
      <li>Case Study 3: <a href="#">Helping a studio choose between two game concepts</a></li>
      <li>Case Study 4: <a href="#">From VR to real-world safety - Helping kids learn to cross the street</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I work</h2>
    <h3>I believe good research is collaborative.</h3>
    <p>Research doesn’t do much good in isolation&mdash;it has to connect with what the team truly needs to know. I love collaborating with designers, PMs, developers, and other partners to get buy-in and create insights that everyone will actually use. I don’t just help teams get answers, I help them ask the right questions.</p>
    <h3>I help teams make informed decisions.</h3>
    <p>I dive into understanding the project, its context, and how research findings will actually be used, so that I can deliver insights at the right time to influence decisions. My research is relevant, drives results, and is always delivered on time and on budget.</p>
    <h3>I bringe diverse methods to get the full picture.</h3>
    <p>I’ve tackled research challenges across many fields, so I know what works&mdash;and when. Whether it’s in-depth interviews that uncover the “why” or data analysis to reveal trends at scale, I choose the right approach for each unique challenge. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, I build a complete picture that neither could provide alone.</p>
    <h3>I turn complex data into insights teams actually use.</h3>
    <p>People don’t connect with data&mdash;they connect with stories. I find real patterns, cut through the noise, and communicate insights in a way that sticks. Because if research doesn’t lead to better results, it’s just theatre.</p>
    <h3>I help research teams build and grow.</h3>
    <p>I’ve set up research processes from scratch, mentored teams, and worked with leadership to integrate research into decision-making. I know how to make research stick&mdash;whether that’s through strong methods, smart operations, or simply getting decision makers to see its value.</p>
