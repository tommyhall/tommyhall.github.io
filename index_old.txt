      <p>Singularity University had launched an online learning portal to complement their offline offerings, and wanted to increase the number of people starting their introductory course and signing up for their course series. I performed an expert evaluation and comparative analysis to identify some areas for improvement, and redesigned several key screens, leading to an increase in user engagement and retention.</p>

      <p>MyBreath is an app that teaches diaphragmatic breathing through a number of exercises, music, and visualization. I was hired to help the BreathResearch team to assess the app, develop personas and user journeys, and create a new, simple, and elegant design direction from the ground up. The new MyBreath app is available now on the App Store.</p>

      <p>The Child Development Research Unit (CDRU) is a research laboratory at the University of Guelph that studies developmental issues related to child health. I was hired to help the CDRU researchers design and build a virtual reality (VR) training system to help teach children to cross the street more safely, in a number of realistic suburban environments. This work has been featured in the Toronto Star and City News, and preliminary studies have shown promising results.</p>

      <p class="services">User Interviews &bull; Expert Evaluation &bull; Personas &bull; UX Design &bull; Wireframes &bull; Prototyping &bull; Usability Testing</p>
      <p>TripSeer is a web application offering intelligent trip planning and itinerary management. It allows users to create trips with multiple destinations, and manage accommodations, activities, and travel methods between their destinations. The client was concerned that while the application was rich with features, it was too complex for users to manage easily. I worked with TripSeer to redesign the landing page and trip planning flow, and tested the designs with users.</p>

      <p>Teleira wanted to create a new user interface for Alert My Community, an emergency notification system in their Critical Communications Platform. The people who use Alert My Community will often be first-time users, so the interface had to be simple and intuitive. I interviewed the stakeholders, performed a comparative analysis of other messaging systems, and created a new interactive prototype of the Alert My Community system, for both web and mobile.</p>
