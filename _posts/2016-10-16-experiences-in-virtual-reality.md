title: Experiences in VR development

With the release of the [PlayStation VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/explore/playstation-vr/) last week, I thought I'd just take 
a few minutes to talk about why VR is such an exciting technology and design space, and some of my experiences working in the field.

### A leap forward

Firstly, it’s thrilling to see how far virtual reality has come just in the last few years. When I started working at the University of 
Guelph’s [CDRU](https://cdru.psychology.uoguelph.ca/cdru) back in early 2012, we were running a fairly straightforward VR simulation. It 
consisted of a single street in a generic-looking neighbourhood, with a stream of oncoming traffic from the left. Our test subjects would
stand on the sidewalk, and try to cross the street safely.

Our equipment was quite limited compared to what’s available today. Positional tracking was handled with a series of (expensive) cameras
mounted to the walls around the simulation room (which were prone to malfunctioning on the regular). The headset itself had a relatively 
low-resolution display, was quite heavy, and was attached to a backpack and a genuine tangle of cables. When a participant in our study 
walked across the street, a research assistant had to walk with them, carrying all of the cables. When the participant reached the other
side of the street and turned to walk back, they had to turn in a particular direction to avoid getting tangled.

Today, the PlayStation VR setup consists of a single PlayStation Camera placed in front of your television, and a single HDMI or USB connection 
to the PlayStation 4. Most importantly, you don’t need a research assistant to follow you around your living room!

### The brain buys in

Perhaps more importantly, the technology available now (the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR) is *much* more immersive than what we 
were using at the CDRU back then. One of the biggest limitations of our headset at the time was its extremely limited field-of-view, or FOV (the
amount of the world visible at any given moment). Our headset at the time had a horizontal FOV of less than 60 degrees, which is 
significantly smaller than a human’s natural FOV (close to 180 degrees). This gave the impression of tunnel vision, meaning you could 
really only see what was more or less directly in front of you.

In comparison, the PlayStation VR has a horizontal FOV of 100 degrees, while the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift sport a horizontal FOV of 110 
degrees. That’s still more limited than natural human vision, but it’s significantly more immersive than what we had available 
even a few short years ago.

When we got our hands on the Oculus Rift DK2, what impressed me the most was how quickly the brain seems to “buy in” to the virtual 
environment, how quickly it seems like you're actually there. In one memorable episode, we had the newest member of our lab’s team try 
on the Rift for the first time, and when he accidentally walked into a tree in our simulation, he threw his hands out in front of him
to brace for the impact, knocking a full cup of coffee all over our equipment.

One issue that VR users might find themselves running into (no pun intended) on account of this immersion is *safety*. Since you’re so 
fully immersed in the virtual world, and have no vision of where you are in the real world, you could easily find yourself running into
a table, tripping over a couch, or some other mishap. Once, while helping to calibrate our simulation, a research assistant walked face 
first into a wall. Luckily, the only thing injured was her pride, but we had to have an additional research assistant making sure that
nobody walked into anything in the future. The PlayStation VR has a smaller workable tracking area (3m by 2m) than we had available, but 
users will have to make sure that their space is clear of hazards (or hire an assistant).

### Wrap

In short, it's great to see this fantastic technology becoming available to more people, and I'm looking forward to seeing it catch on. 
I've got another post coming with some design considerations for developing VR applications, including some issues that we ran into 
atthe CDRU.
