      <p>Hello. I'm a user researcher with experience in games, technology, and behavioural research. I've worked with NetEase, Ubisoft, and BlackBerry, as well as the Child Development Research Unit, a lab focused on child safety and injury prevention.</p>
      <p>I figure out how people use things&mdash;and how to make those experiences better. You can read about some of my past work <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/work">here</a>.</p>
      <p>I've also taken a crack at filmmaking&mdash;if you're into sci-fi horror, check out <a href="http://rancidcargofilm.com">Rancid Cargo</a>, my award-winning short film.</p>
      <p>Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-hall-55087288/">LinkedIn</a> if you'd like.</p>
