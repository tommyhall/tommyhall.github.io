      <p>Hello. I'm a games user researcher at Ubisoft Toronto. I love research and data analysis, and I'm driven by the creativity, problem solving, and continuous opportunity to learn that research offers. I've also had the opportunity to work with the Child Development Research Unit, a research laboratory that focuses on child safety and injury prevention, and with BlackBerry as part of their UX research team.</p>
      <p>I've also taken a crack at filmmaking -- please check out <a href="http://rancidcargofilm.com">Rancid Cargo</a>, a sci-fi/horror project I've been working on.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I write articles on <a href="https://medium.com/@tjphall">Medium</a>. Feel free to check me out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-hall-55087288/">LinkedIn</a>.
